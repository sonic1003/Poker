Poker
=====
Run this project in Visual Studio 2013 IDE.

Input should be 5 cards for each player.

Enter each card like this "5-0"
(the first number is from 2 to 14, which stands for 2-10 and JQKA. The second number is from 0 to 3, which means 4 suits.)

The input is not robust yet, so wrong data format will crash the program.
