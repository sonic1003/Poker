Poker
=====
Run this project in Visual Studio 2013 IDE.

Note:Monodevelop's internal console on Mac/Linux will throw out errors (due to Console.ReadLine), instead, run compiled exe file directly, or configure an external terminal.


Usage:
====
Input should be 5 cards for each player.

Enter each card like this "5-0"
(the first number is from 2 to 14, which stands for 2-10 and JQKA. The second number is from 0 to 3, which means 4 suits.)

The InputController is not robust yet, so wrong data format might crash the program.
